## Coverage Details

### Covered Lines

**Fully Covered Functions:**

- ✅ `calculateBMR()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateTDEE()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateCalorieTarget()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateProteinTarget()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateWaterTarget()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateWeeklyRate()` - 100%
- ✅ `calculateProjection()` - 100%
- ✅ `computeAllTargets()` - ~90%
- ✅ `getWhyItWorksExplanation()` - ~90%
- ✅ `calculateAge()` (private) - 100%

### Uncovered Lines

Lines 115-117, 148-150, 198-200, 236-238, 272-274, 338-340, 400, 477, 510, 582-584

**Analysis:**
These are primarily:

- OpenTelemetry error handling branches (catch blocks)
- Error logging for exceptional cases
- Span exception recording
- Performance warning branches

**Reason:** Low coverage acceptable for error paths that are difficult to trigger in unit tests without mocking the entire tracing infrastructure.
