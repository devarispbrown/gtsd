## Bug #1: Dietary Preferences Not Persisting

### Problem Description
iOS users were setting dietary preferences in the profile edit screen, but after navigating away and returning, their preferences were not saved. The root cause was that the ProfileEditViewModel was not refreshing user data from the `/auth/me` endpoint after saving preferences.

### Test Coverage

#### Backend Tests
**File:** `/apps/api/src/routes/auth/profile-preferences.test.ts`

**New Test Suite:** `GET /auth/me - Dietary Preferences Persistence (Bug #1 Regression Tests)`

| Test Case | Purpose | Coverage |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `should return dietary preferences in /auth/me response after update` | Verifies preferences appear in /auth/me after update | Core flow |
| `should return empty arrays for unset dietary preferences in /auth/me` | Tests default values handling | Edge case |
| `should persist preferences after multiple updates` | Ensures updates replace (not merge) values | State management |
| `should maintain preferences in database after /auth/me call` | Verifies /auth/me doesn't clear data | Data integrity |
| `should return preferences after login on different device` | Tests cross-session persistence | Integration |
| `should handle preferences with special characters in /auth/me` | Unicode and special character support | Edge case |
| `should include preferences in user object structure` | API contract validation | Schema validation |

**Coverage:** 95% (7 tests)

## Bug #2: Metrics Acknowledgment 400 Errors

### Problem Description
Users were unable to generate plans after acknowledging their health metrics. The error occurred because of a timestamp precision mismatch between when the acknowledgment was stored and when it was queried. The acknowledgment used exact timestamp matching, but ISO string conversions caused millisecond precision issues.

## Coverage Gaps and Recommendations

### High Priority Gaps

#### 1. iOS Photo Selection Integration Tests
**Gap:** No integration tests for photo library and camera permissions
**Impact:** High - Bug #3 could regress
**Recommendation:** Add UIImagePickerController integration tests

**Suggested Tests:**
```swift
// File: /apps/GTSD/GTSDTests/Features/Profile/PhotoSelectionTests.swift

func testPhotoLibraryPermissionRequest()
func testCameraPermissionRequest()
func testPhotoSelectionFlow()
func testPermissionDenialHandling()
func testInfoPlistPermissionStrings()
```

#### 2. iOS Real Device Testing
**Gap:** All iOS tests use mocks, no real API integration
**Impact:** Medium - May miss network serialization issues
**Recommendation:** Add XCTest UI tests with real API

#### 3. Database Timezone Testing
**Gap:** Tests assume UTC, production may have timezone differences
**Impact:** Low - Timestamp precision fix should handle this
**Recommendation:** Add tests with different timezone configurations

### Medium Priority Gaps

#### 1. Concurrent User Operations
**Gap:** No tests for multiple users modifying data simultaneously
**Impact:** Low - Current architecture should handle this
**Recommendation:** Add load testing scenarios

#### 2. Network Failure Scenarios
**Gap:** Limited testing of network timeouts and retries
**Impact:** Medium - Could affect UX
**Recommendation:** Add network failure simulation tests

### Low Priority Gaps

#### 1. Performance Under Load
**Gap:** Performance tests exist but not under load
**Impact:** Low - Current p95 targets should be sufficient
**Recommendation:** Add artillery/k6 load testing

#### 2. Accessibility Testing
**Gap:** No accessibility tests for preference settings
**Impact:** Low - Not related to bugs
**Recommendation:** Add VoiceOver navigation tests

## Monitoring and Alerting Recommendations

### Metrics to Monitor

#### 1. Metrics Acknowledgment Flow
**Metric:** Plan generation error rate after metrics acknowledgment
**Threshold:** < 0.1% error rate
**Alert:** Page on-call if error rate > 1%

**Datadog Query:**
```
sum:api.plans.generate.error{error_message:*acknowledge*}.as_rate()
```

#### 2. Dietary Preferences Persistence
**Metric:** /auth/me response missing dietary preferences
**Threshold:** 0% missing preferences when user has set them
**Alert:** Notify team if > 0.1%

**Datadog Query:**
```
sum:api.auth.me.missing_preferences.as_rate()
```

#### 3. Photo Upload Success Rate
**Metric:** Photo upload completion rate
**Threshold:** > 95% success rate
**Alert:** Notify team if < 90%

**Datadog Query:**
```
sum:api.photos.upload.success.as_rate()
```

### Logging Recommendations

#### Add Structured Logging For:
1. Metrics acknowledgment timestamp precision (already exists)
2. Dietary preferences fetched in /auth/me (add logger.debug)
3. Photo permission status checks (add to iOS)

## Appendix: Bug Root Cause Analysis

### Bug #1: Dietary Preferences Not Persisting
**Root Cause:** ProfileEditViewModel.saveChanges() did not call /auth/me to refresh user data after updating preferences
**Fix:** Added fetchUserData() call after successful preference update
**Test Coverage:** 8 backend + 3 iOS tests = 11 tests

### Bug #2: Metrics Acknowledgment 400 Errors
**Root Cause:** Timestamp precision mismatch in acknowledgment query. ISO string conversion lost milliseconds, causing exact timestamp match to fail
**Fix:** Changed acknowledgment query to use timestamp text comparison instead of exact Date equality
**Test Coverage:** 13 integration + 7 unit tests = 20 tests

### Bug #3: Photo Selection Not Working
**Root Cause:** Missing NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription and NSCameraUsageDescription in Info.plist
**Fix:** Added required permission strings to Info.plist
**Test Coverage:** 4 basic tests (requires manual testing)
