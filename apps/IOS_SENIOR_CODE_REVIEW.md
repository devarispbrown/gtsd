---

## 1. Architecture Review

### ✅ Strengths

**1.1 Clean Architecture + MVVM Pattern**

- Excellent separation: Presentation → Domain → Data layers
- Protocol-oriented design enables testing and flexibility
- Actor-based concurrency prevents data races
- SwiftUI @Observable pattern is appropriate for iOS 17+

**1.2 Modern Swift Features**

- Proper use of Swift 6 actors for thread safety
- async/await throughout (no completion handlers)
- Sendable conformance for data types
- Actor isolation for APIClient and repositories

**1.3 Dependency Injection**

- Clean DI container pattern
- Environment-based injection for SwiftUI
- Protocol-based mocking for testing
- Factory methods for ViewModels

### ⚠️ Concerns

**1.4 API Response Wrapper Inconsistency**

**Issue:** The APIClient expects responses wrapped in `APIResponse<T>` format:

```swift
struct APIResponse<T: Decodable>: Decodable {
    let success: Bool
    let data: T
    let cached: Bool?
}
```

However, looking at the backend auth routes (`/Users/devarisbrown/Code/projects/gtsd/apps/api/src/routes/auth/index.ts`), responses are formatted as:

```typescript
res.status(201).json({
  success: true,
  data: result, // result contains { user, tokens }
});
```

This appears correct, but the decoding logic needs to handle nested data structures properly.

**Recommendation:**

```swift
// In APIClient.execute()
private func execute<T: Decodable>(_ request: URLRequest) async throws -> T {
    let (data, response) = try await session.data(for: request)
    try validateResponse(response, data: data)

    // For endpoints that return { success, data: T }
    if let apiResponse = try? decoder.decode(APIResponse<T>.self, from: data) {
        guard apiResponse.success else {
            throw APIError.serverError(
                statusCode: (response as? HTTPURLResponse)?.statusCode ?? 500,
                message: "Server returned success: false"
            )
        }
        return apiResponse.data
    }

    // Fallback for direct T responses
    return try decoder.decode(T.self, from: data)
}
```

**Priority:** HIGH

---

**1.5 Token Refresh Race Condition**

**Issue:** The TokenManager uses a task-based approach to prevent duplicate refreshes:

```swift
private var tokenRefreshTask: Task<AuthTokens, Error>?
```

This is good, but there's a potential race condition if `refreshAccessToken()` is called simultaneously from multiple APIClient requests.

**Current Implementation:**

```swift
if let existingTask = tokenRefreshTask {
    _ = try await existingTask.value
    return
}
```

**Recommendation:**
Add a lock mechanism or use an actor's serial execution guarantee more explicitly:

```swift
actor TokenManager {
    private var tokenRefreshTask: Task<AuthTokens, Error>?
    private var isRefreshing = false

    func refreshAccessToken() async throws {
        // If already refreshing, wait for completion
        if let task = tokenRefreshTask {
            _ = try await task.value
            return
        }

        guard !isRefreshing else {
            // Wait briefly and retry
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000) // 0.1s
            return try await refreshAccessToken()
        }

        isRefreshing = true
        // ... refresh logic
        isRefreshing = false
    }
}
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**1.6 Missing Offline Queue Architecture**

**Issue:** The architecture mentions "offline-first" and "background sync" but doesn't specify implementation details.

**Missing Components:**

- Operation queue for pending network requests
- Conflict resolution strategy for offline changes
- Background task scheduling
- Sync status tracking

**Recommendation:**
Add an OfflineQueue component:

```swift
actor OfflineQueue {
    private var pendingOperations: [PendingOperation] = []

    struct PendingOperation: Codable {
        let id: UUID
        let endpoint: APIEndpoint
        let timestamp: Date
        let retryCount: Int
        let maxRetries: Int = 3
    }

    func enqueue(_ endpoint: APIEndpoint) async
    func processQueue() async
    func clearCompleted() async
}
```

**Priority:** HIGH (if offline support is MVP requirement)

---

### ✅ Architectural Strengths

**1.7 SwiftData Integration**

- In-memory testing configuration
- Proper model relationships
- Unique constraints on IDs
- Metadata as JSON data (flexible)

**1.8 Repository Pattern**

- Cache management with expiration
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Actor-based thread safety
- Clean separation from networking

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Verdict:** Architecture is sound with minor improvements needed

---

## 2. Security Review

### ✅ Strengths

**2.1 Token Storage**

- Keychain for sensitive data ✅
- `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock` is appropriate ✅
- No tokens in UserDefaults ✅
- Automatic token cleanup on logout ✅

**2.2 Biometric Authentication**

- LocalAuthentication framework used correctly
- Proper fallback handling
- Privacy-focused permission requests
- Error handling for all biometric states

**2.3 HTTPS Enforcement**

- Info.plist restricts HTTP (except localhost in dev)
- NSAppTransportSecurity properly configured

### ⚠️ Concerns

**2.4 Certificate Pinning - INCOMPLETE**

**Issue:** The certificate pinning implementation in section 10.1 is incomplete:

```swift
final class CertificatePinner: NSObject, URLSessionDelegate {
    private let pinnedCertificates: [Data]

    func urlSession(
        _ session: URLSession,
        didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge,
        completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void
    ) {
        // Missing: Certificate chain validation
        // Missing: Hostname verification
        // Missing: Public key pinning as alternative
    }
}
```

**Recommendation:**
Implement complete certificate pinning:

```swift
final class CertificatePinner: NSObject, URLSessionDelegate {
    private let pinnedPublicKeys: Set<String>

    func urlSession(
        _ session: URLSession,
        didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge,
        completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void
    ) {
        guard challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust,
              let serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust else {
            completionHandler(.cancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
            return
        }

        // Validate server trust
        var secResult = SecTrustResultType.invalid
        let status = SecTrustEvaluate(serverTrust, &secResult)

        guard status == errSecSuccess,
              secResult == .unspecified || secResult == .proceed else {
            completionHandler(.cancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
            return
        }

        // Extract and validate public key
        if let serverCertificate = SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex(serverTrust, 0),
           let serverPublicKey = SecCertificateCopyKey(serverCertificate),
           let serverPublicKeyData = SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(serverPublicKey, nil) as Data? {

            let serverKeyHash = serverPublicKeyData.sha256Hash()

            if pinnedPublicKeys.contains(serverKeyHash) {
                completionHandler(.useCredential, URLCredential(trust: serverTrust))
                return
            }
        }

        completionHandler(.cancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
    }
}
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Nice-to-have, not MVP blocker)

---

**2.5 Sensitive Data in Logs**

**Issue:** The architecture document doesn't address log sanitization. There's a risk of logging sensitive data:

```swift
logger.info({ email: req.body.email }, 'User signup request')
```

**Recommendation:**
Add a logging policy:

- Never log passwords or tokens
- Mask email addresses (show only domain)
- Sanitize request/response bodies before logging
- Use different log levels for production vs development

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**2.6 Keychain Access Control**

**Strength:** The KeychainService uses `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock`, which is appropriate for tokens that need to survive app restarts but still require device unlock.

**Consideration:** For highly sensitive data, consider:

- `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` for maximum security
- `kSecAccessControlBiometryCurrentSet` for biometric-protected items

**Current implementation is acceptable for MVP.**

---

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Verdict:** Security is strong with minor improvements needed for certificate pinning and logging

---

## 3. Performance Review

### ✅ Strengths

**3.1 Caching Strategy**

- NSCache with size limits (50MB)
- Disk cache for persistence
- Automatic memory management
- Cache expiration (60 seconds for tasks)

**3.2 Image Optimization**

- Compression before upload (max 2MB)
- Quality adjustment (0.8)
- Thumbnail generation for lists
- Lazy loading in galleries

**3.3 Async/Await Pattern**

- No blocking the main thread
- Parallel operations where appropriate (photo uploads)
- Structured concurrency with TaskGroup

### ⚠️ Concerns

**3.4 Performance Targets Are Aggressive**

**Issue:** Some performance benchmarks are overly optimistic:

| Operation         | Target  | Reality Check                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Launch        | < 1.5s  | Realistic for warm start, challenging for cold start with network calls |
| Login API Call    | < 800ms | Unrealistic unless API is <100ms away. Typical API: 200-500ms + network |
| Load Tasks        | < 500ms | Challenging if API call is involved                                     |
| Image Compression | < 500ms | Realistic for small images, may take 1s+ for 4K photos                  |

**Recommendation:**
Revise targets to be more realistic:

```markdown
| Operation              | Target (with network) | Acceptable |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| App Launch             | < 2.5s                | < 4s       |
| Login API Call         | < 2s                  | < 3s       |
| Load Tasks             | < 1s                  | < 2s       |
| Image Compression (4K) | < 1s                  | < 2s       |
```

These are still aggressive but achievable with good implementation.

**Priority:** LOW (documentation issue, not code issue)

---

**3.5 Image Compression Performance**

**Issue:** The `ImageCompressionService` uses a simple loop to reduce quality:

```swift
while let currentData = data,
      currentData.count > maxSizeKB * 1024,
      compression > 0.1 {
    compression -= 0.1
    data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: compression)
}
```

This can result in multiple compression passes (up to 7) which is slow.

**Recommendation:**
Use binary search for faster convergence:

```swift
actor ImageCompressionService {
    func compress(
        _ image: UIImage,
        maxSizeKB: Int,
        quality: CGFloat = 0.8
    ) async -> Data? {
        var minQuality: CGFloat = 0.1
        var maxQuality: CGFloat = quality
        var data: Data?

        // Binary search for optimal quality
        while maxQuality - minQuality > 0.05 {
            let testQuality = (minQuality + maxQuality) / 2
            data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: testQuality)

            guard let currentData = data else { break }

            if currentData.count > maxSizeKB * 1024 {
                maxQuality = testQuality
            } else {
                minQuality = testQuality
            }
        }

        return data
    }
}
```

This reduces compression passes from O(n) to O(log n).

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**3.6 Database Query Performance**

**Strength:** SwiftData queries with predicates and sorting are efficient:

```swift
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<CachedTask>(
    predicate: #Predicate { $0.status == "pending" },
    sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.dueDate)]
)
```

**Recommendation:** Consider adding composite indices for frequently queried fields:

- `(userId, dueDate)` for task queries
- `(userId, status)` for filtered lists

**Priority:** LOW (optimization for later)

---

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Verdict:** Performance strategy is solid with some overly aggressive targets

---

## 4. Code Quality Review

### ✅ Strengths

**4.1 Swift Best Practices**

- Proper use of `guard` for early returns
- Meaningful variable names
- Consistent code style
- Comprehensive error handling

**4.2 Error Handling**

- Custom error types (APIError, AuthError, PhotoUploadError)
- LocalizedError conformance for user-facing messages
- Detailed error descriptions
- Recovery suggestions provided

**4.3 Type Safety**

- Strong typing throughout
- Codable for API models
- Sendable conformance for concurrency
- Protocol-oriented design

**4.4 Code Organization**

- Clear folder structure
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Consistent naming conventions

### ⚠️ Concerns

**4.5 Force Unwrapping in Tests**

**Issue:** Test code contains force unwrapping:

```swift
let apiClient = MockAPIClient()
let keychainManager = MockKeychainManager()
let service = AuthenticationService(
    apiClient: apiClient,
    keychainManager: keychainManager
)
```

This is acceptable in tests, but the mock implementations should fail gracefully.

**Recommendation:**
Mock methods should provide clear error messages:

```swift
case .none:
    fatalError("loginResult not configured in mock - set mockService.loginResult before testing")
```

**Priority:** LOW

---

**4.6 Missing Input Validation**

**Issue:** Some ViewModels validate input, but not all:

```swift
// LoginViewModel has validation
var isFormValid: Bool {
    !email.isEmpty && email.contains("@") && password.count >= 8
}

// But OnboardingViewModel validation is not shown
```

**Recommendation:**
Ensure all user input is validated:

- Email format (regex)
- Password strength (uppercase, number, special char)
- Age range (13-120)
- Weight/height ranges
- Date validations (future dates only for goals)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**4.7 Magic Numbers**

**Issue:** Some magic numbers in code:

```swift
let cache.totalCostLimit = 50 * 1024 * 1024 // 50 MB
let maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
let cacheExpiration: TimeInterval = 60 // 60 seconds
```

**Recommendation:**
Define constants:

```swift
enum CacheConfiguration {
    static let memoryCacheLimit = 50 * 1024 * 1024 // 50 MB
    static let maxPhotoSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
    static let taskCacheExpiration: TimeInterval = 60
}
```

**Priority:** LOW

---

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Verdict:** Code quality is excellent with minor improvements

---

## 5. Testing Review

### ✅ Strengths

**5.1 Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

- Test pyramid: 65% unit, 25% integration, 10% UI
- 80%+ coverage target is realistic
- Clear testing methodology
- Page Object pattern for UI tests

**5.2 Test Organization**

- Separate folders for each test type
- Mock utilities are reusable
- Test fixtures for common data
- Clear test naming (Given/When/Then)

**5.3 Performance Testing**

- XCTMetric usage for performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection tests
- Database query performance tests
- API call performance tests

**5.4 Mock Implementation**

- Protocol-based mocking
- Call count tracking for verification
- Configurable success/failure
- Delay simulation for async testing

### ⚠️ Concerns

**5.5 Flaky Test Prevention**

**Issue:** The testing strategy mentions "no flaky tests" but doesn't provide concrete mechanisms to prevent them.

**Common Sources of Flakiness:**

- Race conditions in async tests
- Time-dependent tests
- Network timeouts
- UI tests with animations

**Recommendation:**
Add flaky test prevention guidelines:

```swift
// Use XCTestExpectation with realistic timeouts
let expectation = expectation(description: "API call completes")
expectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 1
expectation.assertForOverFulfill = true

// Wait with generous timeout for CI
await fulfillment(of: [expectation], timeout: 10.0)

// Disable animations in UI tests
app.launchArguments.append("--uitest-disable-animations")

// Use fixed dates instead of Date()
let fixedDate = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 1700000000)
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**5.6 Missing Integration Tests for Offline Queue**

**Issue:** The testing strategy doesn't mention testing offline functionality:

- Queued operations
- Sync after coming online
- Conflict resolution

**Recommendation:**
Add offline integration tests:

```swift
final class OfflineQueueTests: XCTestCase {
    func testTaskCompletion_WhileOffline_ShouldQueue() async {
        // Simulate offline state
        networkMonitor.isConnected = false

        // Complete task
        await viewModel.completeTask(task, notes: "Test")

        // Verify queued
        let queuedOps = await offlineQueue.pendingOperations
        XCTAssertEqual(queuedOps.count, 1)

        // Go online and sync
        networkMonitor.isConnected = true
        await offlineQueue.processQueue()

        // Verify synced
        XCTAssertEqual(queuedOps.count, 0)
    }
}
```

**Priority:** HIGH (if offline support is MVP)

---

**5.7 UI Test Stability**

**Issue:** UI tests can be brittle. The Page Object pattern is good, but accessibility identifiers need to be consistent.

**Recommendation:**
Create a centralized accessibility ID registry:

```swift
enum AccessibilityID {
    enum Login {
        static let emailField = "login_email_field"
        static let passwordField = "login_password_field"
        static let loginButton = "login_button"
        static let errorMessage = "login_error_message"
    }

    enum Tasks {
        static let tasksList = "tasks_list"
        static func taskCard(_ id: Int) -> String {
            "task_card_\(id)"
        }
    }
}

// Usage in views
TextField("Email", text: $email)
    .accessibilityIdentifier(AccessibilityID.Login.emailField)
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**5.8 Test Execution Time**

**Target:** < 5 minutes total
**Reality Check:** This is ambitious for 280+ tests (200 unit + 60 integration + 20 UI)

**Breakdown:**

- Unit tests: 200 tests @ 0.1s avg = 20s ✅
- Integration tests: 60 tests @ 1s avg = 60s ✅
- UI tests: 20 tests @ 10s avg = 200s ✅
- **Total: ~280s (4.6 minutes)** ✅

**Verdict:** Target is achievable if tests are optimized.

---

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Verdict:** Testing strategy is comprehensive and well-designed

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria Review

### ✅ Strengths

**6.1 Clear and Measurable**

- Specific success criteria for each feature
- Testable conditions
- Performance benchmarks included
- User-facing and technical requirements

**6.2 Comprehensive Coverage**

- All major features covered
- Non-functional requirements included
- Security requirements specified
- Accessibility requirements detailed

**6.3 Definition of Done**

- Clear criteria for feature completion
- Testing requirements specified
- Code review process defined
- Documentation requirements included

### ⚠️ Concerns

**6.4 MVP Scope Creep Risk**

**Issue:** The MVP includes a lot of features:

- Authentication + biometrics
- 8-step onboarding
- Daily tasks with evidence
- Progress photos with S3 upload
- Streaks + badges
- Profile + settings

**Estimated Effort:** 7-8 weeks is tight for all these features.

**Recommendation:**
Consider phased MVP approach:

**Phase 1 MVP (4 weeks):**

- Authentication (email/password only)
- Basic onboarding (4 steps: basics, goals, metrics, submit)
- Daily tasks (view + complete with text evidence)
- Simple streak counter
- Basic profile

**Phase 2 (3 weeks):**

- Biometric auth
- Full 8-step onboarding
- Progress photos
- Badge system
- Advanced settings

**Priority:** HIGH (project management decision)

---

**6.5 Missing Edge Cases**

**Issue:** Acceptance criteria don't cover some edge cases:

- What happens if user completes onboarding but API call fails?
- What if user has tasks for today but API returns empty?
- What if photo upload succeeds to S3 but confirm call fails?
- What if streak is broken but user was offline?

**Recommendation:**
Add edge case acceptance criteria:

```markdown
### Edge Case Handling

**Onboarding Failure:**

- [ ] If onboarding API fails, data is saved locally
- [ ] User can retry onboarding submission
- [ ] User can edit onboarding data before retry

**Task Sync Issues:**

- [ ] If task list is empty, show helpful message
- [ ] If task completion fails, allow retry
- [ ] If offline, queue completion and show pending state

**Photo Upload Failure:**

- [ ] If S3 upload fails, allow retry
- [ ] If confirm call fails after S3 success, handle gracefully
- [ ] If upload is interrupted, cleanup partial uploads
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**6.6 Performance Acceptance Criteria**

**Issue:** Performance targets are aggressive (as mentioned in Performance Review).

**Recommendation:**
Add "acceptable" thresholds in addition to "target":

```markdown
| Operation  | Target | Acceptable | Failure |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- |
| App Launch | < 2.5s | < 4s       | > 5s    |
| Login      | < 2s   | < 3s       | > 5s    |
| Task Load  | < 1s   | < 2s       | > 3s    |
```

**Priority:** LOW

---

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Verdict:** Acceptance criteria are comprehensive but need edge case coverage

---

## 7. API Integration Review

### ✅ Strengths

**7.1 Endpoint Coverage**

- All auth endpoints covered (signup, login, refresh, logout, me)
- Task endpoints (today, create evidence)
- Photo endpoints (presign, confirm, list, delete)
- Onboarding endpoint
- Streaks and badges endpoints

**7.2 Type Safety**

- Swift types mirror TypeScript types from `@gtsd/shared-types`
- Codable conformance for automatic serialization
- Proper date formatting (ISO8601)
- Snake case <-> camel case conversion

**7.3 Error Handling**

- HTTP status codes mapped to domain errors
- Validation errors extracted from API response
- Network errors handled separately
- Retry logic for token refresh

### ⚠️ Concerns

**7.4 Missing API Version Handling**

**Issue:** The API uses `/v1/` prefix but the architecture doesn't address API versioning:

```swift
static var getTodayTasks: APIEndpoint {
    APIEndpoint(path: "/v1/tasks/today", method: .get)
}
```

**Recommendation:**
Add version configuration:

```swift
enum APIConfiguration {
    static let apiVersion = "v1"
    static func path(_ endpoint: String) -> String {
        "/\(apiVersion)\(endpoint)"
    }
}

// Usage
static var getTodayTasks: APIEndpoint {
    APIEndpoint(path: APIConfiguration.path("/tasks/today"), method: .get)
}
```

**Priority:** LOW

---

**7.5 Presigned URL Upload Flow**

**Issue:** The photo upload flow is complex (request presign → upload S3 → confirm) and error handling isn't fully specified.

**Current Implementation:**

```swift
// Step 2: Request presigned URL
let presignResponse = try await apiClient.request(...)

// Step 3: Upload to S3
try await uploadToS3(...)

// Step 4: Confirm upload
let photo = try await apiClient.request(...)
```

**Missing:** What if Step 4 fails after successful S3 upload?

**Recommendation:**
Add retry logic for confirm step:

```swift
func uploadPhoto(...) async throws -> ConfirmPhotoResponse {
    let presignResponse = try await requestPresignedURL(...)

    try await uploadToS3(data: imageData, url: presignResponse.uploadUrl)

    // Retry confirm up to 3 times
    var attempts = 0
    let maxAttempts = 3

    while attempts < maxAttempts {
        do {
            return try await confirmUpload(s3Key: presignResponse.fileKey, ...)
        } catch {
            attempts += 1
            if attempts >= maxAttempts { throw error }
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000) // 1s delay
        }
    }

    throw PhotoUploadError.confirmFailed
}
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

**7.6 Rate Limiting Not Handled**

**Issue:** The API has rate limiting middleware (`/Users/devarisbrown/Code/projects/gtsd/apps/api/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`) but iOS app doesn't handle 429 responses gracefully.

**Current Error Handling:**

```swift
case 429:
    throw APIError.rateLimitExceeded
```

**Recommendation:**
Implement exponential backoff:
