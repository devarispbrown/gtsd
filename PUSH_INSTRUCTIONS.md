# Push Instructions

The branch `feat/monorepo-scaffold` is ready to push, but needs proper GitHub authentication.

## Current Setup

- ✅ Git user configured: `devarispbrown <devaris@devaris.com>`
- ✅ Remote added: `github-personal` → `git@github.com:devarispbrown/gtsd.git`
- ✅ Commit ready: `f0a48d6`
- ✅ No sensitive data in commit (verified)
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore in place

## Authentication Issue

Your SSH key is currently associated with `devarismeroxa` account. You need to authenticate as `devarispbrown`.

## Option 1: Use SSH with Correct Key (Recommended)

1. **Check your SSH keys:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   ```

2. **If you have a separate key for personal account, configure SSH:**

   Edit `~/.ssh/config`:
   ```
   # Personal GitHub account
   Host github-personal
       HostName github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal  # Your personal key

   # Work GitHub account
   Host github-work
       HostName github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Your work key
   ```

3. **Update remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url github-personal git@github-personal:devarispbrown/gtsd.git
   ```

4. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push github-personal feat/monorepo-scaffold
   ```

## Option 2: Use Personal Access Token

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
   - Copy the token

2. **Update remote with token:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url github-personal https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/devarispbrown/gtsd.git
   ```

3. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push github-personal feat/monorepo-scaffold
   ```

## Option 3: Use GitHub CLI (Easiest)

1. **Install GitHub CLI (if not installed):**
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   # Select: GitHub.com
   # Select: HTTPS
   # Authenticate with your browser
   ```

3. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push github-personal feat/monorepo-scaffold
   ```

## After Successful Push

1. **Create Pull Request (if needed):**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head feat/monorepo-scaffold --title "feat: scaffold production-grade monorepo" --body "See DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md for full details"
   ```

2. **Or merge directly to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b main feat/monorepo-scaffold
   git push github-personal main
   ```
