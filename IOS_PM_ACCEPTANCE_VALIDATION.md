| Feature Category        | Status        | Completeness | Notes                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**      | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 100%         | Email/password, biometric, token refresh all covered                 |
| **Onboarding**          | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 100%         | 8-step wizard, validation, health calculations documented            |
| **Daily Tasks**         | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 95%          | View, filter, complete covered. Calendar view deferred to v1.1       |
| **Evidence Submission** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 90%          | Text, metrics, photo supported. Voice memo deferred                  |
| **Progress Photos**     | ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE | 70%          | **GAP: Offline photo uploads need Phase 3-4 offline sync (4 weeks)** |
| **Streaks**             | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 100%         | Current streak, longest streak, compliance calculation               |
| **Badges**              | ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE | 60%          | **GAP: Only "Day One Done" in MVP. Full badge system unclear**       |
| **Profile & Settings**  | ‚úÖ COMPLETE   | 95%          | View, edit, settings covered. Delete account deferred                |
| **Offline Support**     | ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE | 50%          | **GAP: Read-only in MVP (Phase 1-2). Full offline needs 6 weeks**    |

**MVP Feature Gaps:**

1. **Photo Upload Offline** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Current: Online-only in 8-week MVP
   - Offline Sync Doc: Requires Phase 3-4 (weeks 3-4)
   - **DECISION NEEDED:** Include offline photos in MVP or defer to v1.1?

2. **Badge System Scope** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Acceptance Criteria: Full badge system (15 badges)
   - Implementation Plan: Only mentions "Day One Done" badge
   - **DECISION NEEDED:** How many badges in MVP?

3. **Offline Write Operations** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Current: Basic offline caching (read-only)
   - Full Offline: Requires 6-week implementation
   - **DECISION NEEDED:** MVP = Phase 1-2 only (read-only)?

### 1.2 Deferred Features (v1.1+)

**Appropriate Deferrals:**

- ‚úÖ Social features (friend challenges, leaderboards)
- ‚úÖ In-app purchases (premium plans, streak freezes)
- ‚úÖ Apple Watch app
- ‚úÖ Widgets
- ‚úÖ HealthKit integration
- ‚úÖ Siri Shortcuts
- ‚úÖ App Clips

**Questionable Deferrals:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Full offline sync (might be expected in fitness app)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calendar view of tasks (useful for planning)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced photo management (comparison tools)

---

## 2. User Experience Validation

### 2.1 Offline Support Adequacy

**Current Plan:**

- **Phase 1-2 (MVP, Weeks 1-2):** Read-only offline cache
  - View cached tasks (24 hours old)
  - View cached photos (thumbnails only)
  - View streak data (last synced)

- **Phase 3-4 (Post-MVP, Weeks 3-4):** Offline queue
  - Complete tasks offline
  - Upload photos offline
  - Automatic sync when online

**PM Assessment:**

| Scenario                    | MVP Support        | User Impact | Acceptable?           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| View tasks on airplane      | ‚úÖ Cached          | LOW         | YES                   |
| Complete task on airplane   | ‚ùå Requires online | HIGH        | **NO - Major UX gap** |
| Take progress photo offline | ‚ùå Requires online | HIGH        | **NO - Core feature** |
| View badge progress offline | ‚úÖ Cached          | LOW         | YES                   |
| Update profile offline      | ‚ùå Requires online | LOW         | YES                   |

**RECOMMENDATION:**

- **Option A (Conservative):** Ship MVP with online-only writes, clearly communicate limitation
- **Option B (Recommended):** Extend timeline to 10 weeks, include Phase 3-4 offline queue
- **Option C (Aggressive):** Ship 8-week MVP, add offline writes in v1.1 (1-2 weeks post-launch)

**VERDICT:** Current offline support is **INSUFFICIENT** for fitness app MVP. Users expect to complete tasks/take photos at gym (poor cell coverage).

### 2.2 Error Handling

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

| Error Scenario       | Planned Handling                  | User-Friendly?          | Grade |

| Server 500 error     | Generic message + support contact | ‚úÖ YES                  | A     |
| Photo upload failure | Queue for retry, show progress    | ‚úÖ YES                  | A     |
| Conflict detection   | Auto-resolve (server-wins)        | ‚úÖ YES                  | B+    |
| Cache corruption     | Clear cache, refetch              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires user action | B     |
| Queue full           | Block new actions                 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Could lose data      | C     |

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. Add graceful degradation for queue full (show warning before blocking)
2. Improve cache corruption UX (automatic recovery)
3. Add retry UI for failed operations

### 2.3 Performance Targets

**Acceptance Criteria vs. Plan:**

| Operation          | Target | Plan   | Met?   |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| App launch (cold)  | <3s    | <2.5s  | ‚úÖ YES |

## 4. Timeline & Scope Assessment

### 4.1 Timeline Analysis

**Original Estimate:** 7-8 weeks (Implementation Plan)
**Offline Sync Estimate:** 6 weeks (Phase 1-6)
**Executive Summary:** 8-10 weeks realistic

**Reconciliation:**

| Component                     | Optimistic  | Realistic     | Buffer | Total        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Foundation (API, Auth)        | 2 weeks     | 2 weeks       | +0     | 2 weeks      |
| Core Features (Tasks, Photos) | 2 weeks     | 2.5 weeks     | +0.5   | 2.5 weeks    |
| Offline Sync Phase 1-2        | 2 weeks     | 2 weeks       | +0     | 2 weeks      |
| Polish & Testing              | 2 weeks     | 2 weeks       | +0.5   | 2.5 weeks    |
| Bug Fixes & Unknowns          | 0 weeks     | 1 week        | +1     | 1 week       |
| **TOTAL**                     | **8 weeks** | **9.5 weeks** | **+2** | **10 weeks** |

**Confidence Assessment:**

| Timeline | Probability | Risk Level | Recommendation       |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 7 weeks  | 10%         | VERY HIGH  | ‚ùå **Do not commit** |
| 8 weeks  | 40%         | HIGH       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Aggressive, risky |
| 9 weeks  | 70%         | MEDIUM     | ‚úÖ Likely achievable |
| 10 weeks | 90%         | LOW        | ‚úÖ **Recommended**   |

**VERDICT:** **Timeline is REALISTIC at 10 weeks, AGGRESSIVE at 8 weeks.**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Commit to 10-week timeline externally, target 9 weeks internally.

### 4.2 Scope Creep Risks

**High Risk Areas:**

1. **Offline Sync Scope Creep** (CRITICAL)
   - Documented: 6 phases over 12 weeks
   - MVP Claim: 8 weeks total
   - **RISK:** Team may try to build full offline sync in MVP
   - **MITIGATION:** Explicitly define MVP = Phase 1-2 only

2. **Badge System Expansion**
   - Acceptance Criteria: 15 badges
   - Implementation Plan: Mentions only "Day One Done"
   - **RISK:** Unclear scope could lead to overbuilding
   - **MITIGATION:** Define exact badge list for MVP (recommend 3-5)

3. **UI Polish & Animations**
   - No specific time allocation
   - Could consume weeks if not managed
   - **RISK:** Engineer-driven perfection seeking
   - **MITIGATION:** Define "done" criteria, time-box polish phase

**RECOMMENDATION:** Hold 2-hour MVP scoping session THIS WEEK to define:

- Exact offline sync features (Phase 1-2 only)
- Badge system scope (3-5 badges vs. 15)
- UI polish acceptance criteria
- Hard deadlines for each phase

**Title:** "GTSD - Get That Shredded Done"
**Subtitle:** "Track, Achieve, Transform"
**Keywords:** fitness tracker, workout log, progress photos, accountability, streaks, habits, gym companion
**Category:** Health & Fitness
**Screenshots:** 5 required (highlight onboarding, tasks, photos, streaks, badges)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Prepare App Store assets in parallel with development (Week 6-8).

### 9.3 Risk Communication

**User Expectations Management:**

| Feature          | MVP Capability                   | Communication Strategy                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Offline Support  | Read-only cache + limited writes | "View tasks offline, sync when connected"       |
| Badge System     | 3-5 badges (if limited)          | "Earn achievement badges" (don't specify count) |
| Photo Management | Basic upload + grid view         | "Track progress with photos"                    |

**Recommendation:** Under-promise, over-deliver. Communicate limitations clearly in TestFlight notes.
