# Better Debugging Approach: How to Actually Fix Issues

## The Problem with Our Current Approach

We keep making the same mistakes:

1. Assuming the fix we wrote is the fix that's running
2. Not verifying deployment before testing
3. Testing in contaminated environments
4. Making multiple changes simultaneously
5. Not establishing baselines

## The New Approach: VERIFY ‚Üí FIX ‚Üí VERIFY

### Core Principles

1. **Never trust, always verify**
2. **One fix at a time**
3. **Clean state for every test**
4. **Document everything**
5. **Prove the fix is deployed**

## Step-by-Step Debugging Protocol

### Phase 0: Stop Everything

Before you write a single line of code:

```bash
# STOP! Don't skip this phase

# 1. Document current state
echo "=== Debug Session Started: $(date) ===" >> debug.log
echo "Issue: [Describe exact issue]" >> debug.log
echo "User Report: [Exact error message or behavior]" >> debug.log

# 2. Capture evidence
# - Screenshot the error
# - Save network requests
# - Copy error messages
# - Note exact reproduction steps
```

### Phase 1: Establish Clean Baseline

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# clean_baseline.sh

echo "=== Establishing Clean Baseline ==="

# 1. Save current work
git status
read -p "Save current changes? (y/n): " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    git stash save "Debug baseline $(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
fi

# 2. Clean Xcode
echo "Cleaning Xcode..."
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GTSD-*
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode
xcodebuild clean -project apps/GTSD/GTSD.xcodeproj -scheme GTSD

# 3. Reset Simulator
echo "Resetting Simulator..."
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl erase all

# 4. Clean backend
echo "Cleaning backend..."
cd apps/api
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf dist

# 5. Document baseline
echo "Baseline established at: $(date)" | tee -a debug.log
```

### Phase 2: Reproduce and Document

**Before fixing, reproduce the issue systematically:**

```markdown
## Reproduction Checklist

### Environment

- [ ] iOS Version: **\_\_\_**
- [ ] Device/Simulator: **\_\_\_**
- [ ] Backend URL: **\_\_\_**
- [ ] Build Configuration: Debug/Release

### Steps to Reproduce

1. [ ] Step 1: **\_\_\_**
2. [ ] Step 2: **\_\_\_**
3. [ ] Step 3: **\_\_\_**

### Expected Result

- ***

### Actual Result

- ***

### Network Requests (if applicable)
```

Request:
[Method] [URL]
Headers: **\_\_\_**
Body: **\_\_\_**

Response:
Status: **\_\_\_**
Body: **\_\_\_**

```

### Error Messages
- Console: _______
- UI: _______
- Network: _______
```

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Investigation

**Before writing code, understand the problem:**

```swift
// Add diagnostic code FIRST

// Example: Investigating metrics issue
func acknowledgeMetrics() async {
    print("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Starting metrics acknowledgment")
    print("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Computed at: \(metricsData.metrics.computedAt)")
    print("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Computed at string: \(metricsData.metrics.computedAtString)")

    // Log the exact request being sent
    print("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Request body will be:")
    print("  - version: \(metricsData.metrics.version)")
    print("  - metricsComputedAt: \(metricsData.metrics.computedAtString)")

    // Original code here...
}
```

### Phase 4: Single Fix Implementation

**Rules for implementing fixes:**

1. **Create a fix branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-name-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Add fix verification**

   ```swift
   // ALWAYS add a verification stamp
   private let FIX_VERSION = "issue-name-v1.0-20251030"

   func fixedFunction() {
       print("üîß FIX ACTIVE: \(FIX_VERSION)")
       // Your fix here
   }
   ```

3. **Commit immediately**

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: [Issue name] - [Brief description]

   - Added [specific change]
   - Fixed [specific problem]
   - Version: issue-name-v1.0-20251030"
   ```

### Phase 5: Deployment Verification

**CRITICAL: Verify the fix is actually deployed**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify_deployment.sh

echo "=== Verifying Deployment ==="

# 1. Check git status
echo "Git Status:"
git status --short
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå WARNING: Uncommitted changes detected!"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Check build time
BUILD_TIME=$(stat -f "%Sm" ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GTSD-*/Build/Products/Debug-*/*.app 2>/dev/null)
echo "App built at: $BUILD_TIME"

# 3. Check for fix verification in logs
echo "Starting app and checking for fix verification..."
# Run app and grep for fix version
xcrun simctl launch booted com.gtsd.app 2>&1 | grep "FIX ACTIVE"
```

### Phase 6: Testing Protocol

**Test in a clean environment:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_fix.sh

echo "=== Testing Fix ==="

# 1. Ensure clean state
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.gtsd.app 2>/dev/null

# 2. Install fresh
xcodebuild install -project apps/GTSD/GTSD.xcodeproj -scheme GTSD

# 3. Start logging
echo "=== Test Started: $(date) ===" >> test_results.log

# 4. Launch with logging
xcrun simctl launch booted com.gtsd.app --console >> test_results.log 2>&1 &

# 5. Monitor logs for fix verification
tail -f test_results.log | grep --line-buffered "FIX ACTIVE"
```

### Phase 7: Verification Checklist

**For EVERY fix, complete this checklist:**

```markdown

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: "It works on my machine"

**Problem**: Testing in your development environment with cached data

**Solution**:

```bash
# Always test in fresh environment
./clean_baseline.sh
./test_fix.sh
```

### Pitfall 2: "I fixed it but it's still broken"

**Problem**: Fix isn't deployed or old code is cached

**Solution**:

```swift
// Always add verification
print("üîß FIX ACTIVE: photo-picker-v1.2-20251030")
// If this doesn't appear in console, fix isn't deployed
```

### Pitfall 3: "Multiple fixes at once"

**Problem**: Can't tell which fix worked or caused new issues

**Solution**:

```bash
# One fix per branch
git checkout -b fix/single-issue
# Fix one thing
# Test thoroughly
# Then move to next issue
```

### Pitfall 4: "Works in simulator, fails on device"

**Problem**: Simulator has different behavior than real device

**Solution**:

```bash
# Test on real device early
xcodebuild -project apps/GTSD/GTSD.xcodeproj \
          -scheme GTSD \
          -destination 'platform=iOS,name=Your iPhone' \
          clean build
```

## Debugging Toolkit

### 1. Network Inspection

```bash
# Use mitmproxy to see actual requests
mitmproxy -p 8888

# Configure simulator
xcrun simctl proxy booted set http://localhost:8888
```

### 2. State Inspection

```swift
// Add state dumping
func dumpState() {
    print("=== STATE DUMP ===")
    print("User: \(authService.currentUser)")
    print("Preferences: \(currentUser?.dietaryPreferences)")
    print("Onboarding: \(currentUser?.hasCompletedOnboarding)")
    print("==================")
}
```

### 3. Version Tracking

```swift
struct DebugInfo {
    static let fixes = [
        "metrics-iso8601-v1.0",
        "preferences-fetch-v1.0",
        "photo-picker-v1.0"
    ]

    static func printActive() {
        print("üöÄ Active fixes: \(fixes.joined(separator: ", "))")
    }
}

// Call on app launch
DebugInfo.printActive()
```

### 4. Error Capture

```swift
// Enhanced error reporting
enum ErrorReporter {
    static func capture(_ error: Error, context: String, file: String = #file, line: Int = #line) {
        print("‚ùå ERROR at \(file):\(line)")
        print("‚ùå Context: \(context)")
        print("‚ùå Error: \(error)")
        print("‚ùå Stack: \(Thread.callStackSymbols)")
    }
}
```

## Testing Matrix

For each fix, test these scenarios:

| Scenario              | Test Case                 | Expected Result               | Actual Result | Pass/Fail |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Fresh Install         | New user, first launch    | No crashes, proper onboarding |               |           |
| Existing User         | User with saved data      | Data persists, no redirect    |               |           |
| Network Error         | Backend unavailable       | Graceful error handling       |               |           |
| Slow Network          | 3G throttling             | UI remains responsive         |               |           |
| Background/Foreground | App suspension            | State preserved               |               |           |
| Permission Denied     | Photo/notification denial | Proper permission UI          |               |           |
| Data Migration        | Old app version update    | Data migrates correctly       |               |           |

## The Golden Rules

1. **If you didn't see the fix version in logs, it's not deployed**
2. **If there are uncommitted changes, you don't know what's running**
3. **If you didn't clean build, you might be running old code**
4. **If you didn't test in fresh environment, results aren't valid**
5. **If you can't reproduce it, you can't verify it's fixed**

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Clean everything
./clean_baseline.sh

# Verify deployment
./verify_deployment.sh

# Test in fresh environment
./test_fix.sh

# Check what's running
xcrun simctl launch booted com.gtsd.app --console | grep "FIX ACTIVE"

# Network debugging
mitmproxy -p 8888

# State reset
xcrun simctl erase all

# Git status check
git status --porcelain

# Build verification
stat -f "%Sm" ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GTSD-*/Build/Products/Debug-*/*.app
```

## Conclusion

The key to successful debugging is not writing fixes faster, but verifying that your fixes are actually running. Most "difficult" bugs are actually simple bugs with deployment problems.

**Remember**:

- Trust nothing
- Verify everything
- Document all findings
- Test in clean environments
- One fix at a time

Success comes from methodology, not from trying harder.
