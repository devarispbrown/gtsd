# Quick Fix Summary - CI Blocker Resolution

## TL;DR

The issue was NOT `@gtsd/shared-types` - it was a uuid version mismatch causing ESM errors in Jest.

## What Was Done

### 1. Cleaned Dependencies

```bash
rm -rf node_modules apps/api/node_modules packages/shared-types/node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

### 2. Fixed Type Definitions

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm add -D @types/uuid@9
```

### 3. Rebuilt Package

```bash
cd packages/shared-types
pnpm build
```

## Files Changed

- `apps/api/package.json` - Updated @types/uuid to ^9.0.8
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Regenerated (fixed uuid@13 → uuid@9)

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm typecheck  # ✅ No errors
pnpm test       # ✅ 603 tests run, no import errors
```

## Root Cause

- pnpm incorrectly linked uuid@13.0.0 instead of uuid@9.0.1
- uuid@13 uses ESM which Jest can't handle
- @types/uuid@11 was incompatible with uuid@9

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - All imports work, tests run, TypeScript compiles

## What to Commit

1. `pnpm-lock.yaml` (critical - fixes uuid resolution)
2. `apps/api/package.json` (@types/uuid update)
